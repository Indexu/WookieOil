## Getting Started

In order to run WookieOil on your own machine, you will need [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) in order to use npm to install the dependencies and run the server.

### Prerequisites

After installing node.js, make sure node is in your PATH and run the following command in your CLI in order to install the dependencies required.

```
$ npm install
```

### Running the server

To start up the server by running server.js, located in the src/ directory, with node.
From the root directory of the project run the following command in your CLI.

```
$ node src/server.js
```

Now the server is up and running on port 3000 by default.

### Development

We use Gulp as our build system. It should have been installed when you ran the install with npm.
Simply run the following command in the root directory of the project to start up gulp.

```
$ gulp
```
